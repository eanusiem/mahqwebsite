    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <h2>Students of All Healthcare-Related Disciplines!</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-left">
    The mission of MAHQ is to be a change agent to improve the quality of healthcare across the state by supporting our members’ efforts to achieve excellence in healthcare delivery. We feel we can best accomplish this mission by not only supporting current members, but also by reaching out to students to help prepare them to be change agents from the moment they start their careers.
    </p><br>
    <p class="paragraph-left">
    Our actively working members are already making great progress in changing the culture of healthcare to one of quality care and continuous improvement. We recognize, however, that if every student who is enrolled currently in a program of study related to healthcare and medicine was trained in quality improvement/assurance principles and methodologies before they started their careers, that such a change could be swift and systemic. Such a change could be monumental, and for many patients, life-changing.    
    </p><br>
    <p class="paragraph-left">
    MAHQ is pleased and proud to be working with Michigan Colleges and Universities to aid them in educating students from a spectrum of healthcare fields to become change agents, and work toward healthcare excellence as they prepare for their chosen careers in the healthcare industry.

        FREE Webinar: Analysts Surf the Tsunami of Healthcare Data
    </p><br>
    <p class="paragraph-left">
    Good surfers are the consummate analysts. They dynamically process streams of seemingly unrelated information bypassing lesser opportunities, then strategically select the perfect wave. The ability to tease out genuine opportunities amidst a tumult of noise is a hallmark of great analysts. By attending this webinar you will learn: 1) The human elements of a great analyst, 2) How to re-frame the role of technology in analysis, and 3) Healthcare knowledge required to maximize the value of a healthcare analyst. John’s engaging presentation style leverages simple and fun analogies to galvanize key concepts for technical, clinical, and executive audiences alike. Join us as he brings principles from the world of surfing and applies them to healthcare analytics.
